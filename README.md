This is an experiment in Artificial Intelligence.  The code was forked from Hans HÃ¼bner's work on:

https://github.com/hanshuebner/html-scrabble

Modifications include preparation for autonomous players and AI bots by allowing for remote play.  Interacts with my unrelased
Bot Framework.  Strategies depend on selected bot default-intelligence level.  Bots make use of a
Gaddag Data Structure.  Information can be found at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GADDAG

This code is dual purpose.  It provides a playground for my educational bots and a starting point for hosted code-competitions at the 
L.A. Computer Science Reading Group in Santa Monica, CA
where I regularly attend and study AI specific concepts and techniques.
